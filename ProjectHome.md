## Comelysome TC Settings ##
### About ###
This project is used to post settings for the awesome <a href='http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/terrain-control/'>Terrain Control</a> Bukkit mod.

I have spent way too much time experimenting with TC until I ended up with settings that I felt happy with. I'm uploading these settings here on the off-chance that someone else might find them useful.

The world is divided into four region types and max height is doubled (256):

  * Dry region is quite flat and easy to traverse. It consists of desert with interspersed mesa hills and savanna.
  * Ocean region is mostly ocean with some scattered reefs.
  * Temperate region can produce some epic landscapes and can be slightly difficult to traverse. It consists of big forested hills with occasional overhangs. Further inland big rocky mountains raise above the forest. The mountains are crossed by grassy valleys and are a bit easier to traverse.
  * Snow region has forested foothills similar to the temperate region. Inland there are snowy mountains that contains glaciers, mountain peaks and sparse taiga forests.

Some notes:
  * The Mesa biome has custom ore settings. Rare ores will spawn all the way up to sea level.
  * Prismarine and sea lanterns spawn as ore veins just under the top layer of the reefs.
  * Horses spawn in savanna.
  * There are no swamps.
  * There are no villages or special buildings.
  * Strongholds, nether fortresses, old-style dungeons and mine shafts are enabled (although mine shafts are _VERY_ rare)
  * The doubled max height is quite heavy on the vanilla Minecraft client. I've found that <a href='http://optifine.net/home'>Optifine</a> is quite useful for increasing performance client side.
  * If you want to tweak it: In the biomeconfigs directory all files beginning with an underscore are used. The other files are auto generated by the mod but not used by this setup.

Enjoy!
